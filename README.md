# js-proxies-ui-framework
Just a Simple and Stupid UI framework based on JavaScript proxies and Virtual Dom. It's like building your own [MobX](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), but in a shitty way! :)

## Run
    yarn install
    npm start
    
Enjoy!

## Live Demo
